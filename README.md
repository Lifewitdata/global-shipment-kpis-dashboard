# Global Shipment KPIs Dashboard

This project involves building an interactive dashboard to visualize key performance indicators (KPIs) for global shipments. It includes data cleaning, transformation, and delay trend analysis, using Python libraries such as **Seaborn**, **Matplotlib**, and **Pandas**. The project identifies high-delay routes and operational inefficiencies, providing valuable insights to support cost-reduction strategies in logistics operations.

## Features

- **Interactive Dashboard**: Visualize global shipment KPIs like average delays by country and trade route.
- **Automated Data Cleaning**: Use of Pandas for cleaning and transforming the shipment data.
- **Delay Trend Analysis**: Analyze shipment delays over time to identify patterns.
- **Operational Inefficiencies**: Model shipment data to highlight high-delay routes.

## Tools and Libraries

- **Python**: The main programming language used.
- **Seaborn**: For creating informative and attractive visualizations.
- **Matplotlib**: Used alongside Seaborn for advanced plotting capabilities.
- **Pandas**: For data cleaning, transformation, and analysis.
- **Jupyter Notebook** : For interactive exploration and analysis.
